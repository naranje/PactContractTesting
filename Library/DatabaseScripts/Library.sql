Perl has always been a powerful and popular programming  language, but with its new object capabilities, it can do even  more. Written for anyone with a little Perl experience, Damian  Conway''s Object Oriented Perl provides an invaluable guide to  virtually every aspect of object-oriented programming in Perl.
 The  most notable thing about Object Oriented Perl is Conway''s  excellent perspective on object-oriented concepts and how they are  implemented in Perl. This book does a remarkable job of cutting  through traditional jargon and illustrating how basic object-oriented  design techniques are handled in Perl. (A useful appendix attests to  the author''s wide-ranging knowledge, with a comparison of Smalltalk,  Eiffel, C++, and Java with Perl, including a summary of  object-oriented syntax for each.) This book also features a truly  excellent review of basic Perl syntax.
 Throughout this text, the  author shows you the basics of solid object design (illustrated using  classes that model music CDs). Basic concepts like inheritance and  polymorphism get thorough and clear coverage. The book also points out  common mistakes and provides many tips for navigating the powerful and  flexible (yet sometimes tricky) nuances of using Perl objects. For  instance, Conway shows how to achieve true data encapsulation in Perl  (which generally allows calls across modules) as well as its natural  support for generic programming techniques. 
 He also pays special  attention to popular object modules available from CPAN (like  Class::MethodmakerK, which simplifies declaring classes) and  discusses performance issues and the tradeoff between programming  convenience and speed often faced by today''s Perl developer. Advanced  chapters cover a number of techniques for adding persistence and  invoking methods using multiple dispatching.
 Filled with syntactic  tips and tricks, Object Oriented Perl is a sure bet for any  programmer who wants to learn how to use Perl objects  effectively. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Perl  language review, CPAN, Perl objects, ''blessing'' and inheritance,  polymorphism, Class::Struct and Class::Methodmaker modules, Perl ties  and closures, operator overloading, encapsulation, multiple dispatch,  Class::Multimethods, coarse-grained and fine-grained object  persistence techniques, performance issues.

Despite their tremendous popularity, design patterns are extremely challenging to learn. Now there''s an introduction designed to help beginners get up-to-speed fast -- and help them overcome the obstacles that stand in their way. The best way to teach design patterns is to present key tradeoffs and heuristics through practical examples. In The Joy of Patterns, Brandon Goldfedder does just that, presenting a series of system designs from initial conception through code. The book''s examples illustrate the use of patterns to design systems that will be implemented in Visual Basic, C++, and Java. Goldfedder focuses on a core subset of patterns, drawing upon the work of the "Gang of Four" and other leaders in the field. Along the way, he covers the most common applications for patterns, illuminating the pros and cons designers need to consider in making key decisions about system architecture. For all application developers, programmers, project managers, architects, and others who want to master patterns -- including those who have previously found them difficult to learn.

One of the most important recent developments in software  engineering is the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard for  documenting software designs. Written by UML''s inventors (the  so-called Three Amigos of software engineering), The Unified  Modeling Language User Guide provides a very appealing guide to  all the fundamentals of using UML effectively. The book opens with a  basic tour of the essential concepts and modeling diagrams used in  UML, including class diagrams, use case diagrams, and basic modeling  principles. The authors pay close attention to modeling classes (and  documenting the relationships between classes) as well as use case  diagrams (which show how software will be used by various actors in a  system). This book mixes in a little software-engineering theory, too,  but it makes use of clear examples and actual UML diagrams to  illustrate key concepts.
 Later in the book, the authors discuss  more difficult notational diagrams (such as state diagrams and  activity diagrams, which can be used to model behavior in a  system). Whatever your background in software engineering, you''ll no  doubt appreciate the author''s clear explanations of basic (and  advanced) modeling concepts, as well as the nuts-and-bolts details of  today''s powerful UML. With its combination of expert modeling advice  and excellent detail on the specifics of UML, this book will be  absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to use UML for  real-world software design. --Richard DraganProduct Description
Just as architects and musicians need architectural drawings or music scores to be written using standard notations that everyone agrees on and understands, developers need a single, common, widely usable modeling language for the development of software systems. The UML has been proposed as this standard and has received the support of academic and industry heavyweights.  The Unified Modeling Language User Guide is the first of three definitive UML works written by the creators of UML, Grady Booch, Jim Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson. Together these three widely respected and world-famous methodologists form an unbeatable author team representing combined worldwide sales of their prior individual books of more than 250,000 copies. This book will introduce the core 80% of the UML, approaching it in a layered fashion and providing numerous examples of its application. The Unified Modeling Language User Guide is suitable for developers unfamiliar with UML or with modeling in general.

INSERT [dbo].[Book] ([Id], [Title], [Summary], [Authors], [Url], [Isbn], [Published], [Publisher], [Binding]) VALUES (7, N'Real-Time UML: Developing Efficient Objects for Embedded Systems', N'Amazon.com Review
It''s no surprise that object-oriented analysis and design can  work for embedded systems--such as those in VCRs, car engines,  elevators, pacemakers, and other hardware devices--which far outnumber  traditional computers. That''s the argument of Bruce Douglass''s  Real-Time UML, which presents the latest modeling techniques  using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) in the context of embedded  design. This book is a successful introduction to both UML and the  vagaries of embedded systems, which have their own set of pitfalls and  constraints for efficiency and high reliability.
Real-Time  UML is good at presenting the basics of modeling objects, from  class design to object behavior, with an eye for the rich set of  diagrams available in UML used along the way. Examples, from elevators  to medical systems, are used to illustrate the theory.
 The authors  are up to speed with the latest research on "patterns"  (reusable higher order designs) that can be used for embedded  systems--especially within the chapters on design. It''s obvious from  this clearly written and comprehensive book that embedded systems can  benefit from the methodology and notational strengths of UML. This  manual avoids the abstraction of a lot of software engineering texts  and relies on some good real-world detail for its examples. It''s  definitely a recommended source for any embedded-systems developer who  wants to ramp up on the new details of UML.

Product Description
Second Edition now available! Real-time systems programmers face unique challenges. Qualities such as execution speed and memory size are paramount in the development of real-time systems, and performance is a fundamental aspect of correctness in this domain. Given these constraints and requirements, it is fair to say that the development of real-time systems is more challenging than that of most software systems. Yet the lack of a standard notation and design process has discouraged embedded systems developers from adopting a revolutionary new approach to software design--object technology--that has produced clearly identifiable benefits in less specialized software applications.  With the development and wide adoption of a standard notation, the Unified Modified Language (UML), real-time systems developers can now avail themselves of the benefits and advantages of object technology. UML is a 3rd generation modeling language which rigorously defines the semantics of the object metamodel and provides a notation for capturing and communicating object structure and behavior. It is particularly well-suited to modeling real-time and embedded systems.Real-Time UML is the introduction that developers of real-time systems need to make the transition to object-oriented analysis and design and modeling with UML.  It covers the important features of the UML and shows how to effectively use the UML to model real-time systems. The book includes special in-depth discussions of finite state machines, object identification strategies, and real-time design patterns to help beginning and experienced developers alike. 0201325799B04062001

For the several million developers using "traditional" Visual Basic 6, Microsoft Visual Basic .NET Step by Step will put the new VB .NET within reach with a very approachable tour of the new version''s features used to build traditional client-side software. If you''ve been put off by the newfangled books on .NET that spin the new VB as Internet-focused and unrelated to your existing expertise, this title shows you how to leverage your knowledge to get going with Microsoft''s newest platform.
The salient feature of this text is the author''s patient presentation style, which stresses "traditional" VB programming. (While VB 6 did technically support Web programming, the unarguable reality is that most developers have built form-based programs for years.) This volume shows you how to use the same techniques for the new VB .NET. The author begins his presentation here with a clever slot-machine application to get you started. Other early sections cover the basics of VB .NET from a language perspective, including basics like variables, data types, and flow control statements. This handsomely printed volume makes use of two-toned color (in blue) to highlight differences between VB 6 in VB .NET, making it an invaluable resource for programmers making this transition.
Other essential technologies get their due here as well, from basic control programming with Windows Forms, integrating with ActiveX controls, to a very approachable guide to the new ADO.NET APIs for databases. Coverage of how to bind data to a variety of controls, plus using the new VB .NET DataGrid control, will show you how to do all you did in VB 6 in the new .NET. Instead of getting bogged down in details, the author does a good job of presenting what working programmers need to know. Later chapters delve into .NET APIs for working with files, strings, and collections. This title doesn''t pretend to cover ASP.NET in any detail, though there is a useful introduction to the subject, as well as how to use the Microsoft Internet Explorer Object to build VB applications that display HTML and other Internet content.
The reality is that most VB 6 programmers will have to learn a lot when it comes to .NET. Before launching into a whole new paradigm of Web development, this book shows that today''s VB has a lot to do with the older VB 6 standard. This text will be nearly indispensable for any VB 6 programmers making the leap to .NET. It even suggests that rumors of the death of the traditional client-side VB application may be somewhat exaggerated. This title shows you that the new easier deployment and productivity features of VB .NET may extend the life of such applications in one of the best-available tutorials for learning VB .NET, bar none. --Richard DraganProduct Description
